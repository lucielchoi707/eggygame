# Eggy Game

## Overview

Eggy Game is a two-player strategy game where players (user and AI) take turns placing pieces on a grid. The objective is to connect pieces in a line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game allows the player to choose from different piece sizes (Large, Medium, and Small) to strategically place on the board. The larger pieces can replace smaller opponent pieces, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

## Features

- **Piece Selection**: Players can choose from Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S) pieces, each with a specific count.
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, with larger pieces replacing smaller opponent pieces.
- **Win Condition**: Players win by forming a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of their pieces. If the board is filled and no one has won, the player with the most pieces wins.
- **Instructions**: A modal shows the game rules and instructions for the player to understand how to play.
- **Turn-based System**: The game alternates between the user and AI turns. Players can also toggle who goes first.
